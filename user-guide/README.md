# README

This website is generated using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It uses the [book](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/hugo-book/) theme, which provides some nice constructs on top of raw markdown.

# Getting Started

1. Install [hugo_extended_0.68.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.68.0).

   :warning: Pick the **extended** version!!

2. Run `hugo server -t book`

   This creates a live-reloading server that compiles and serves the static website on http://localhost:1313/adrestia/user-guide.

# Deploying

The static website is automatically built and deployed by a continuous integration environment when merged into the `master` branch.
