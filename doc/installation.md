Installation Instructions
=========================

## Using Docker (recommended)

Docker images are continuously built and deployed on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/inputoutput) under specific tags. Using docker provides **the fastest** and **easiest** user experience for setting up the Cardano stack. This is the preferred solution. 


The following images are available for each component of the Adrestia architecture:

### Semantic

|                  Tag                  |                                                                                                                                                                     Semantic                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `latest`                              | Points to the latest __stable__ image for the corresponding component. This is also the tag to which `docker` defaults when pulling without an explicit tag. These typically points to latest known release that happens at the end of an iteration cycle. Depending on the project / component, the iteration cycle may vary from 1 to 2 weeks. |
| `MAJ.MIN.PATCH` or `YYYY.MM.DD-byron` | Must match actual releases of the corresponding component. Refer to each of the component's release notes to know which release tags are available.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `master`                              | Points to the very tip of the development branch. This is therefore __not recommended__ for production but can be useful to try out features before they are officially released.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `byron`                               | A special tag pointing to the very tip of the development branch on `cardano-wallet`. `cardano-wallet` does support both `jörmungandr` and `cardano-node` at the same time, but corresponding images are packaged separately. The `byron` tag therefore points to a version of `cardano-wallet` compatible with cardano-node in OBFT mode.       |

### Examples

For example, to use `cardano-node@1.10.0`, you can run:

```
docker pull inputoutput/cardano-node:1.10.0
```

Similarly, one can pull `cardano-wallet@v2020-04-07` with:

```
docker pull inputoutput/cardano-wallet:v2020.4.7-byron
```

> **HINT**  _About version compatibility_

For version compatibility between components, refer to the compatibility matrix on each component's main page (For instance, [cardano-wallet#latest-releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet#latest-releases)).

### Docker compose

Some components also provide example setup via [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Those are useful for a quick start or as a baseline for development. See for example [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/master/docker-compose.yml), [cardano-graphql](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) or [cardano-rest](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-rest/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).

## Pre-compiled Artifacts / Building From Sources

If you prefer using raw binary, some components provide pre-compiled release artifacts for each release. These can be downloaded directly from the github servers, via the UI, or using a command-line tool like `wget` or `cURL`. For example, you can download a pre-packaged linux binary for `cardano-wallet@v2020-04-07` via:

```
curl -L https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/releases/download/v2020-04-07/cardano-wallet-v2020-04-07-linux64.tar.gz | tar xz

./cardano-wallet-byron-linux64/cardano-wallet --help
The CLI is a proxy to the wallet server, which is required for most commands.
Commands are turned into corresponding API calls, and submitted to an
up-and-running server. Some commands do not require an active server and can be
run offline (e.g. 'mnemonic generate').

[...]
```

If you want to compile everything from sources, refer to each repository's documentation. As a pre-requisite, you may want to install and configure [Nix](https://nixos.org/), [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) or [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) depending on your preferences. Build instructions are available on each repository's main README.
