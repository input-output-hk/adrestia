**About cardano-wallet**

Cardano-wallet comes with a command-line interface (CLI) that can be used as a quick alternative to cURL or wget to interact with a server running on localhost. Every endpoint of the API is mapped to a corresponding command that often offers a better user experience than directly interacting with the API as a human (API are for programs, command-lines are for humans).

For example, restoring a wallet goes normally through POST /byron-wallets, or can be done interactively with:

`$ cardano-wallet wallet create MyWallet`

The CLI also provides some useful helpers, such as a command to generate mnemonic sentences, or doing key derivation. For more details, see the wallet command-line user manual.
