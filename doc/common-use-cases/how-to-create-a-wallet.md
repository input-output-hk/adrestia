The easiest and most common way of managing your funds on the Cardano blockchain is through a [hierarchical-deterministic-wallets](../key-concepts/hierarchical-deterministic-wallets.md). You can create a wallet using the following endpoint of [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet):

[`POST /byron-wallets`](https://input-output-hk.github.io/cardano-wallet/api/edge/#operation/postByronWallet)

There are several wallet types available:
 - Random
 - Icarus
 - Trezor
 - Ledger

The basic difference is that, for a `random` wallet, the user needs to [create new address](how-to-create-addresses.md) manually, whereas for sequential wallets -like `icarus`, `trezor` and `ledger`-, the addresses are [generated automatically](how-to-create-addresses.md#listing-addresses-in-sequential-wallets) by the wallet.

> **DANGER**:  Note that `random` wallets are considered **deprecated** and should _not_ be used by new applications.

Note also that a single `cardano-wallet` server can operate many wallets.
